# scatter-skeleton
A basic website / blog template using [Scatter](https://github.com/lordbenjamin/scatter) and [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton).

# Credit
Most of the credit goes to the original authors of Scatter and Skeleton. I've just pulled the pieces together and put a bit of a structure around them.
